3. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Multiline Comment)
      Approach: I understood that the implemented of the Multiline Comment was similar
      to single comment line, so I decided to add an  nested else if on the '/' if block.
      Here I'd need to make sure when are in the multine part of the code, we can check when
      we get out and break the loop.

      Issues and resolution: I had an issue where the Scanner where I didn't really add a break
      point in the 2nd nested loop of the code.

   Problem 2 (Operators)
      Approach: Here I add the the Operators on TokenInfo, and then I proceed to just where I would
      Scan them on Scanner.java.

      Issues and resolution: No Issues, pretty simple
   
   Problem 3 (Reserved Words)
      Approach: Similar to Problem 2, where I add the Reserved Words on the TokenInfo.java. Then
      there's a section that has all the Reserved words being placed on Scanner.java. I added the
      Reserved words there, similar to how the others were added.

      Issues and resolution: Quite Simple and no Issues

   Problem 4 (Literals)
      Approach: Extremely hard, I wasn't unsure where to start working on this. But given that we
      had an intliteral example, I looked at it and realized that I could add upon it for Long
      literal and double literal. Long literal was a simple if statement, then I created tons of
      nested else ifs for Double since they have so much versions of literals.

      Issues and resolution: This took most of my issuess, and time. I had to constantly check if I
      was right and by doing that I just got the output of Literals.java and compared it with
      Literal.Tokens. I was adding a lot of ')' into the literals so I had to clean that out. Just
      testing it constantly over and over made it easier to fix but a bit more tedious.

   CS451/651 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

5. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   It was pretty interesting implementing a double literal, a lot of nested ifs I had to add in.
   I could've considered implementing switchcase and I think that might have made it a bit easier.
